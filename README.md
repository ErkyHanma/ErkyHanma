### 💭 Philosophy

> *"There's no such thing as a painless lesson; they just don't exist. Sacrifices are necessary. You can't gain anything without losing something first. Although if you can endure that pain and walk away from it, you'll find that you now have a heart strong enough to overcome any obstacle. Yeah… a heart made Fullmetal."*
>
> **— Edward Elric, Fullmetal Alchemist**

This philosophy drives my approach to development. Every bug, every challenge, every late night debugging session shapes me into a stronger developer. I embrace the struggle because I know that's where real growth happens.
